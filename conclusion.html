                For me, the definition of philosophy has changed throughout the quarter. When I first joined the class, I thought philosophy to be a tool to understand existence, truth, and ethics. I believed philosophy to be a field that was abstract, limited, and understood by a small number of aging experts who specialize in this field. However, as the quarter progressed and I delved deeper into philosophical texts from our class readings and engaged in discussions, my initial definition of philosophy was disrupted. It transformed from a niche field consisting of elderly men discussing theoretical principles to a relevant tool that is applicable in my daily life to help me better understand the world around me, along with the societal and personal issues I encounter. 
Initially, during the first week of class, when we discussed the different aspects of reality, I assumed those lessons would be reflective of the remaining classes. I believed the class would be disconnected from the realities of everyday life and just go deep into debates on topics I could not relate to. However, after we started the weekly readings, my initial belief began to transform from an abstract and unrelatable subject to a tool to critically analyze and address a diverse range of problems, including societal, ethical, and environmental. This tool is a guiding framework that improved my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The change in definition from an academic pursuit to a practical tool has shaped my view of the world and the way I approach new challenges. It is like a compass that aids me in successfully navigating the complicated affairs I encounter in college, work, and home. It altered my mind by building upon and improving my previous understanding of life to be a more self-conscious and responsible person. 
Philosophy today means to me a nearly inseparable skill I picked up that will assist me in comprehending ideas, thoughts, and issues more clearly, act as a guiding structure in my day-to-day life as a student, assist in building closer connections with my family and my peers and in the future help me navigate through the dynamics of my career. Overall, philosophy is an invaluable piece of knowledge that I learned.

                When this class started, I thought of philosophy as a very sophisticated way of thinking. I only knew about it because of the famous Greek philosophers, but after reading non-traditional views, my view of philosophy has changed. For me, philosophy has been a way of self reflection and gratitude. After taking this class philosophy means more than a way of thinking, but something connects individual concepts to a bigger picture. I catch myself too concerned about my personal life and achievements and now, it has extended my outlook. It’s interesting how Philosophy involves personal introspection, but makes connections to humanity and the environment as a whole because When you connect these personal thoughts to bigger ideas about humanity and the world, you start seeing how your beliefs fit into the larger picture. It's like finding your own puzzle piece in the puzzle of humanity. So, philosophy is like a journey of self-discovery that also links you to the bigger story of people and the world around you. Also, reading non-traditional Chinese philosophers has made me see philosophy in a new light. It opens a door to different ways of thinking about life and big questions. These philosophers from China bring new ideas and perspectives that I hadn't considered before. I realized philosophy has many different pieces that all fit together for a larger message.  So, my view of philosophy has become more colorful and diverse, showing me that there's not just one way to understand the world and our place in it. Lastly, I’ve gained a new respect and interest in philosophy because I find the concepts interesting and thought provoking. It’s important for everyone to reflect on society and oftentimes it's difficult as there is not a lot of positivity going on. Philosophy allows us to open a third eye in a sense and see things in a positive and progressive light.

                Reflecting on my evolving understanding of philosophy, it has become a great tool for diving deeper into the assumptions and ethical problems that are seen in our world. Initially, my knowledge of philosophy was limited, but as the course progressed, it has grown a lot and is now a framework for comprehending the connections to be made between technology and society.

These readings have not only widened my view of humanity but also made me rethink how societal ideas connect with my computer science studies. The close link between technology and social norms has become more obvious, making me reconsider how people from different backgrounds navigate the world. This realization emphasizes the responsibility that comes with technological innovation, pushing me to help create a fair and inclusive technological world.

As I navigate the mix of computer science and philosophy, these subjects have become a strong force shaping both my studies and personal values. Using what I learned has changed how I see technology, highlighting the important role of ethics in guiding innovation.

It was very interesting to see how varying opinions not only by the authors but also by you my classmates were able to change the way I now view things. Rather than simply disagreeing or agreeing with what was being across all texts I now try to find the deeper reasoning behind these views. 

In conclusion, these readings, enriched by Yancy's perspectives, have given me a detailed understanding of how technology, philosophy, and society connect. These insights go beyond theory, now affecting my identity and guiding my choices as a computer science major.

                For me, philosophy is a lot more personal than I thought at first. I didn’t know how much philosophy could be applied to different disciplines, while still carrying over themes of the self and inner exploration. It taught me that the opportunity to look at oneself and self-reflect can be a part of anything ranging from nature to music. Initially perceiving philosophy as an abstract realm of thought detached from everyday concerns, I now see its vital role in shaping our understanding of existence and guiding our actions in the world. The practical applications of philosophical principles in addressing ethical dilemmas and societal issues have been especially eye opening. I've come to appreciate philosophy as a study that encourages me to question, critique, and challenge the things which I thought I already knew. This course has given me a newfound appreciation for the interconnectedness between philosophical questions and real lived experience.
