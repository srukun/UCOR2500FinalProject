            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
                As a computer science major, the reading Look A White! by George Yancy gave me a unique perspective on the intersection between technology, ethics, race, and systematic biases. Computer science is a field focused on technicality and innovation, but Yancy's readings have expanded my perspective on the broader implications surrounding computer science. One issue I reflected on is the recent surge in the popularity of artificial intelligence and the ethical and moral implications it has on our daily lives. For example, in the reading, Yancy discussed the concept of profiling leading to the mistreatment of minorities due to their racial background. This idea connects to artificial intelligence because humans train AI models, and their functionality depends on the dataset used for training. The dataset's choice has the potential to create AI that can be unethical, immoral, and discriminatory. Unfortunately, creating hateful chatbots is common. One specific example is Microsoft's Tay, a Twitter chatbot released in the mid-2010s trained through conversing with users on social media. Tay was shot down quickly after its release for promoting hate. Tay's example concerns future chatbots and their engagement in social media, news articles, images, and videos. Reflecting on Yancy's discussion on profiling, he discussed that the media's role in reinforcing racial stereotypes and disseminating hateful messages resonates with the potential for artificial intelligence to do the same. The growing usage of AI technologies requires us to be more critical and considerate about its implications for promoting biases. In addition, another area I reflected on in connection to Yancy's readings and my major is the involvement of technology in violence. In the text, he discussed the involvement of government bodies using tactics to harass, profile, and commit violence against black people solely based on their race. Often, software is involved in surveilling individuals, spreading discriminatory practices, and amplifying biases, which can result in systemic injustices within society. This caused me to be conscious of the jobs I apply to, specifically avoiding ones that require me to create software for law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, or government entities where the technology is utilized to perpetuate discriminatory practices or contribute to systemic injustices against certain racial or ethnic groups. Overall, Look A White! George Yancy complimented my studies in computer science by emphasizing the importance of ethical, racial, and societal considerations in technology. It broadened my perspective on the impacts of technology on society, encouraging me to approach my field with a more ethical mindset.

            <p>
                Studying philosophy has helped me become a better business leader in important ways. First, it encourages me to think carefully and consider different viewpoints when facing complex problems. This kind of thinking is super useful in the fast-paced and ever-changing world of business. Secondly, philosophy teaches me to make decisions not just based on what works, but also on what's right. It helps me think about the ethical side of things. Furthermore, ethics is a key topic in business and through philosophy, I’ve been forced to think about my ethics because when you hear contradicting or different ideas, it makes you think about your own. The readings further the sense of my own ethics and morals and I’m grateful for that because it takes good morals to make a good leader. Outside of my major, studying  philosophy has made my life better. It helped me think more carefully about things, like making decisions and facing challenges. I also started paying more attention to what I believe in and why. This made me more aware of what's right and important to me. Plus, philosophy taught me to keep an open mind, to understand different points of view, and to always be ready to learn. So, it's like having a guide that helps me make good choices, stay true to my values, and keep growing as a person. In addition, philosophy helps you be thankful by making you think about what really matters in life. When you think about big questions and consider different perspectives, you start appreciating the simple and important things around you like good moments, people who care about you, and the experiences that shape your life. Philosophy teaches you to see the value in what you have, creating a sense of gratitude for the meaning that life brings.

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>Embarking on the intersection of computer science and philosophy has without a doubt transformed my outlook as a computer science major, especially with the insights shared by George Yancy. In the field of computer science, where my focus mainly revolves around solving problems and engaging in logical thinking, these readings have broadened my horizons, prompting me to acknowledge that there's a large number of considerations beyond the technicalities of the field. Yancy's discussions on "felt invisibility" and the "elevator effect" have pushed me to contemplate the biases and assumptions in the technology we create, significantly raising my awareness about the potential unintended consequences that our creations may carry. I've developed a better sense of responsibility, aiming to ensure that the technology I contribute to is not only efficient but also fair and accessible to everyone.

                In my day-to-day life, these readings have also factored into various parts, greatly influencing my interactions with people and shaping my decisions when deciding how I engage with people to make them feel seen. This newfound awareness of societal issues, particularly those related to racial and cultural dynamics, has made me more open to the diverse ways in which people experience the world. It has also influenced the choices I make during coding, pushing me to go beyond mere functionality and prioritize ethical considerations in the design and implementation of technological solutions.

            <h3>Psychology</h3>
            <p>
                As a psychology major, it made me reflect on how philosophy was already a part of what I've already studied. A large part of psychology as a whole deals with issues of ethics and guidelines. This section of psychology really values ethical practices and focuses a lot on informed consent, especially when conducting research. There are also many philosophical ideas used in therapy that heavily focus on the value of us individually as human beings, and how connecting with others positively impacts our outlook on the world. Something that is used in psychology which relates to “Rap Music”, is that psychology makes very clear distinctions of experience. There are many methods of therapy which make it clear that one’s lived experience can be very separate and different, than another's. This helps with issues relating to cognition and can help individuals deal with past and present issues. Many other methods of psychology which relate to philosophy include behaviorism and humanism which both focus on the behaviors and actions of people as individuals.
