let lookAWhite = new Book("Look A White!", "George Yancy", "The reading Look, a White! by Georgy Yancy altered and expanded my comprehension of what it truly means to be human, particularly concerning the complexities of racial identity and the systemic biases rooted in society. Yancy's work delves into the complexities of human experiences, shedding light on how race significantly shapes one's identity and influences social interactions within the broader societal framework.One of the critical aspects of Yancy's text that impacted my understanding is his exploration of racial stereotypes and their influence on ordinary people's lives. He highlighted the perceptions and behaviors that result from factors such as systemic prejudices and inequalities.The concept of racial profiling in encounters with law enforcement has complicated my view on fairness in the justice system and society. Yancy's inclusion of accounts of individuals being stopped and treated differently solely based on their race, a factor they have no control over, diminished my previously positive picture of equality and fairness in government bodies. In addition, the discussion around the media's portrayal and representation revealed how stereotypes perpetuate throughout common culture, causing me to be more critical of the narratives we consume daily and their impact on shaping our perceptions of race. The intersectionality of race, gender, and class was another thought-provoking aspect that added to my prior understanding. His acknowledgment of the unique challenges faced by black women due to the systems of oppression found in our society unlayered the complexities of identity and discrimination individuals can go through.The psychological effect of racial profiling, the constant surveillance, and the harassment experienced by black individuals solely due to their race questioned my previously held belief of safety and belonging. It created a framework for me to reflect upon the feeling of being secure in a society that subjects you to suspicion and scrutiny based on your skin color. These readings have prompted me to critically reevaluate my preconceived notions about fairness, equality, and societal structures. It complicated my understanding by revealing the entrenched nature of systemic biases and the impact of racial stereotypes on individuals' experiences, encouraging me to engage in more nuanced discussions about race, identity, and social justice.",

let TheForceOfNonViolence = new Book("The Force Of Non Violence", "Judith Butler", "Judith Butler’s “The Force of Non-Violence” supplemented my understanding of what it means to be human by challenging the idea of violence vs non violence. Through her argument that non-violence and self defense don’t exist unless we think of society as a whole and not a group of individuals. By challenging the idea of individualism, Butler made me think about the coexistence of humans and how we are meant to live amongst each other, but systemic violence has polarized people into an individualistic mindset. By societal constructs, humans are infiltrated by a demographic imaginary such as race, gender, ethnicity, and age. Butler argues “We do need an altered state of perception, another imaginary, that would disorient us from the givens of the political process” (Butler, 64). This implies a hierarchy in lives which justify the idea that some humans are valued more than others. The hierarchy limits people to what they believe is possible and puts systemic constraints on groups of individuals. After reflecting on butler’s philosophy, I believe to be human is to embrace our duty to each other and our environment. Through societal expectations, humans are imprisoned to expectations of each other and rather than embracing differences and coming together, humanity is very polarized in today's society. With the number of events and conflicts going on, I feel that humans have lost sight of the beauty of being human and living on earth. Before this reading, I wasn’t fully aware how powerful these structures are. A lot of societal structures are built to put humans up against each other and we need to break out of the box society puts us in. When more people realize this, we will see change in how we interact with each other and hopefully humanity can learn to love one another so we can focus on issues bigger than us. ",

let PhenomenologyofInvisibility = new Book("Phenomenology of Invisibility", "Boram Jeong", "What we've been reading in our course, especially Yancy talking about Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man,\" has seriously changed how I think about what it means to be human. Yancy kicks it off with the \"elevator effect,\" pointing out how black males often get seen as threats that need protection. He also dives into \"felt invisibility,\" saying it's a type of violence from societal norms and how white folks see things. A big idea that got me thinking is this \"seen absence\" concept. Yancy breaks it down, showing how, in the eyes of white people, Black people can be in your face visible but still treated like they're invisible. It's like they're there, but not really seen. And when you extend this to Asian Americans or \"yellow\" bodies, it adds another layer. Even if they're noticed, they're often ignored or pushed aside in how white people see things. This got me thinking about how people with different skin colors have time and space forced onto them. The idea that being white might be a problem in how people see and understand things is pretty interesting. It suggests that whiteness could hold you back, limiting how you think and connect with the world. To sum it up, this reading, especially with Yancy's take, describes the challenging parts of how people see and understand race. The \"elevator effect,\" \"felt invisibility,\" and the \"seen absence\" show how different racial groups go through things. It's not just about societal norms but also about how our own perspectives shape the way we see the world. As I process these deep thoughts, I'm pushed to rethink my own views and be part of a more open and understanding take on humanity.",

let PhenomenologyofRapMusic = new Book("Phenomenology of Rap Music", "Harry A. Nethery", "“A Phenomenology of Rap Music” by Harry A. Nethery discusses hip hop and rap as an artform, and how it is consumed by people of different races. This reading talked about one’s lived experience and how it has been expressed through music. The reading focuses a lot of its attention on how non-black people can consume rap even though it has deep roots in black culture and is from black experiences in the United States. This reading helped my understanding of what it means to be human because it shines a light on how one’s actual lived experience cannot be fully understood by another, even if consumed as an art form. It helped me understand that while one may be consuming this music, there are feelings both mental and physical which they may not feel as deeply, because they don’t have the same lived experience. This reading also shows that music has the ability to connect cultures. Putting out one's lived experience as music gives others the ability to appreciate such an intimate part of their life. Nethery talks about this as “the gift” because it is an invitation for one to self-reflect about their relationship to the rap that they listen to. This reading really showed some of the complexities of racial visibility and how it is felt through music. The quote in this reading that I felt had the most impact was from George Yancy who said that this “gift” delivers, “the emotional and cognitive dissonance that will be inevitably experienced as they become more and more attentive to the ways in which they are entangled in the social and psychic web of white racism.” (Nethery 127)",
